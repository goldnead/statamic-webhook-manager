/**
 * Where a brand's flat files live, and which of them a read may open.
 *
 * ## Brands live in the path, not in the file
 *
 * Under multi-brand every brand owns a directory and the type directories sit
 * inside it:
 *
 *     content/webhooks/{brand}/outbound/{handle}.yaml
 *     content/webhooks/{brand}/inbound/{handle}.yaml
 *     content/webhooks/{brand}/rules/{handle}.yaml
 *     content/webhooks/{brand}/templates/{handle}.yaml
 *
 * The alternative — a `brand:` key inside each YAML — was rejected. The handle
 * is the filename here, so a key would give every definition two identities
 * that can disagree, and reading one brand's hooks would mean opening every
 * other brand's file to find out they are not yours. A missing or misspelt key
 * would then fall through to the default brand, which is a leak that looks like
 * a typo.
 *
 * That matters more in this package than in a CRM. A webhook config carries a
 * destination and the credentials it authenticates with, so a cross-brand read
 * is not "one tenant sees another's data" — it hands over a bearer token, and
 * firing the hook from the wrong brand posts one tenant's payload to another
 * tenant's endpoint.
 *
 * With a directory the isolation is structural: a brand's read never opens
 * another brand's file, and being in the wrong place is visible in `ls` and in
 * a diff.
 *
 * ## The pre-brand layout keeps working
 *
 * Single-brand installs — the overwhelming majority, and every install before
 * 1.4 — keep writing to `content/webhooks/outbound/…` exactly as before. No
 * directory appears, nothing moves, there is nothing to do.
 *
 * Under multi-brand those files are read as the **default brand's**, and only
 * the default brand's, until `webhook-manager:migrate-flat-brands` moves them.
 * They were written before brands existed, so they belong to the brand every
 * existing row was backfilled onto — and to no other brand, ever. An install
 * that enables the flag must never open to an empty webhook list.
 *
 * ## Fail closed
 *
 * Multi-brand with no current brand — a console run, a queue worker — resolves
 * to `null`: read nothing. Not everything. That matches the eloquent driver's
 * global scope, so the two drivers agree about the one case where guessing
 * would leak.
