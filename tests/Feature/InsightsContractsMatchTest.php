/**
 * The guard over the copy.
 *
 * `tests/Fakes/insights-contracts.php` claims to be the analytics addon's
 * contract copied byte for byte, and until this file existed, nothing checked
 * that claim. The sibling is neither a `require` nor a `require-dev`, so its
 * `interface_exists` locks never engage: the copy is what the whole suite runs
 * against **and** what PHPStan analyses through `scanFiles`. A method added to
 * `Metric` upstream would therefore leave every test here green and fatal on
 * the first install that has both addons — a green suite over a contract that
 * no longer exists is worse than no suite, because it is believed.
 *
 * So the copy is held against the original wherever the original can be found:
 * installed in `vendor/`, or checked out beside this package, which is how the
 * family is developed. Where it cannot be found the test skips and says why —
 * a machine without the sibling cannot answer the question, and pretending
 * otherwise is the failure this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * The comparison runs through a second PHP process
 * (`tests/Support/insights-contract-probe.php`) because both sides declare the
 * same fully qualified names and one process can hold only one of them.
 *
 * The contract is semver-locked from the release onwards. This is the thing
 * that notices when it moves anyway.
